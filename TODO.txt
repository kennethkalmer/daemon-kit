= DaemonKit TODO List

This is purely a drop in the bucket of what has to come...

* Support for chroot'ing
* Altering process names (fully and temporary appending)
* bleak_house support
* Support for tweaking REE environment variables prior to launch (bash wrapper)
* Clustering support (run multiple workers out of same project)
* [IN PROGRESS] Error handling to the degree Rails does
  * Support for custom error handlers in the project
* Easy configuration of an ORM of choice, including patching it if needed (ActiveRecord *cough*)
* Improved generators for creating skeleton daemons:
  * Empty periodic event loop
  * Empty periodic loop (non-evented)
  * Queue (SQS, etc) pollers
* Rake tasks for generating:
  * Sys-V style init scripts
* Plenty of docs, seriously a lot of docs
* Specs & features, tons of them too
* Integration tests for the specific daemons
* Some level of thread safety, or mechanisms to ease thread safety
* Built in utilities:
  * Fibre pool for 1.9
  * Some activesupport-esque functions until activesupport 3.0 hits the streets
* DRY up the following:
  * Loading configuration files for the daemons
